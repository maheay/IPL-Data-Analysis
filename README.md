Data Analysis using IPL Data from 2008 to 2017
üèè IPL Data Analysis Project

I recently completed a comprehensive data analysis project focusing on the Indian Premier League (IPL), leveraging Apache Spark and PySpark.
Key Highlights:
Data Collection: Gathered IPL cricket data from multiple CSV files stored in an Amazon S3 bucket.
Data Cleaning: Performed thorough data cleaning operations to ensure consistency and accuracy, including filtering out invalid deliveries such as wides and no-balls.
Data Transformation: Utilized PySpark's powerful functions to calculate various statistics, such as total and average runs scored in each match and inning, and running totals of runs in each match for each over using window functions.
Exploratory Data Analysis: Conducted in-depth exploratory data analysis to uncover insights into player performance, match outcomes, and the impact of toss decisions on match results.
Visualization: Created insightful visualizations using Matplotlib and Seaborn to effectively communicate findings and trends discovered during the analysis.
Insight Generation: Derived actionable insights to aid stakeholders in strategic decision-making, including player selection strategies, match tactics, and team performance evaluation.
